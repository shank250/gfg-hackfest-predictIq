# Sales Product Recommendation API using Azure OpenAI and Flask

## Overview

This project is a Flask-based API that integrates with Azure OpenAI GPT-4 to recommend suitable financial products (such as loans, credit cards, insurance, etc.) based on customer details. The API takes customer information as input and uses the GPT-4 model to predict which product would best suit the customer.

## Features

- **Customer Data Input**: Accepts customer details (e.g., age, income, credit score).
- **Sales Product Recommendation**: Uses Azure OpenAI's GPT-4 model to recommend a sales product.
- **RESTful API**: A Flask-based API that returns recommendations based on the input provided.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework for Python
- **Azure OpenAI**: For interacting with the GPT-4 model
- **Python**: Backend programming language
- **Azure**: Cloud platform for deploying the model
